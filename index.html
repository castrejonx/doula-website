    <!-- My Story -->
    <section id="mystory">
        <h2>My Doula Journey</h2>
        <p>
            When I was pregnant in 2010 I had no idea what a doula was. To be honest all things pregnancy grossed me out. I took Childbirth and Breastfeeding classes to try and be the best mom I could be. I went into labor at 36 weeks. I had no real idea of a birth plan yet. The Anesthesiologist came in the room with a menu of his services. I politely declined and told him I was going to try and go med-free but if I changed my mind we would give him a call. He said “You will be calling me”. When he walked out I told my Husband “I don’t care what happens, do not let me call that man”. My L&D nurse was a traveling nurse and happened to be a Doula back home in Idaho. She was so helpful in helping to advocate the kind of birth I chose to have. She was calm, encouraging, gave many techniques for breathing, relaxing, pain relief and helped me meet my goal of my proverbial birth plan which all aided in not calling the arrogant Anesthesiologist. From the moment I held my sweet baby I knew I loved it all: Pregnancy, Labor, breastfeeding… every single moment. That day I fell in love with this “Doula” idea and longed to help advocate and support Mothers with whatever their birth plan might be.
