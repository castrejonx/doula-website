    <h2>Benefits of Hiring a Doula</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Reduced Cesarean Births:</strong> The presence of a doula has been linked to a significant decrease in cesarean deliveries. Research indicates that doula-assisted mothers are 39% less likely to have a cesarean birth compared to those without continuous support.

        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Shorter Labor Duration:</strong> Continuous support from a doula can lead to shorter labors. Studies have shown that the average length of labor decreases by approximately 41 minutes when a doula is present.

        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Decreased Use of Pain Relief Medications:</strong> Women supported by doulas are less likely to request pain relief medications. Specifically, there is a 10% decrease in the use of any medications for pain relief among those with doula support.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Higher Rates of Spontaneous Vaginal Birth:</strong> The continuous presence of a doula increases the likelihood of spontaneous (non-induced) vaginal births by 15%, reducing the need for interventions such as labor induction or augmentation.

        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Improved Neonatal Outcomes:</strong> Babies born to mothers who had doula support are 38% less likely to have a low five-minute Apgar score, indicating better overall health and reduced need for immediate medical attention.

    <h2>My Doula Journey</h2>
        <img src="images/about-photo.png" alt="[Sister-in-law's Name]" class="about-photo">
        <p>
            When I was pregnant in 2010 I had no idea what a doula was. To be honest all things pregnancy grossed me out. I took Childbirth and Breastfeeding classes to try and be the best mom I could be. I went into labor at 36 weeks. I had no real idea of a birth plan yet. The Anesthesiologist came in the room with a menu of his services. I politely declined and told him I was going to try and go med-free but if I changed my mind we would give him a call. He said “You will be calling me”. When he walked out I told my Husband “I don’t care what happens, do not let me call that man”. My L&D nurse was a traveling nurse and happened to be a Doula back home in Idaho. She was so helpful in helping to advocate the kind of birth I chose to have. She was calm, encouraging, gave many techniques for breathing, relaxing, pain relief and helped me meet my goal of my proverbial birth plan which all aided in not calling the arrogant Anesthesiologist. From the moment I held my sweet baby I knew I loved it all: Pregnancy, Labor, breastfeeding… every single moment. That day I fell in love with this “Doula” idea and longed to help advocate and support Mothers with whatever their birth plan might be.
